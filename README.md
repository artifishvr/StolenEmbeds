Built with itty-router and cloudflare workers, this allows embedding unusual videos in Discord, such as >500 megabyte videos or AV1-encoded videos.

Inspired by [stolen.shoes](https://stolen.shoes/) and [FixTweet](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter).

## Usage

Put `https://e.nya.llc/` in front of the video URL, like so:
`https://e.nya.llc/https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4`
